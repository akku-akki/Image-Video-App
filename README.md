 2. A short explanation of what you built.
  
  This app fetches photos and videos from Pexel's APi in an Pagination form
  and once loaded a user can see the Image and its details by tapping on it and for videos a user can play video by tapping on video. A user can add or remove the Images and videos to favorites by tapping on fav button.

 3. How to test/demo/run 
     get packages 
     and run command `flutter run`

 4. Any feedback/notes (i.e. if something was hard, confusing, frustrating, etc)
     
     if something was hard -- Not That Hard,
     confusing --- yes in beginning, 
     frustrating -- no

   what you would add/change if you had more time
    
    Really I would have changed the pagination Stratergy from the current current Plugin So I would have a golbal List of photos and videos and some logics so I will be able unmark favs from Favorites Page.
    Make UI a bit attractive
